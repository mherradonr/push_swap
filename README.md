sa	swap a - swap a - swaps the first two elements on top of stack a.
sb	swap b - swap the first two elements on top of the stack b.
ss	swap a y swap b at the same time.
pa	push a - takes the first element of stack b and puts it on top of stack a.
pb	push b - takes the first element of stack a and puts it on top of stack b.
ra	rotate a - moves all elements of the stack up to one position, the first element becomes the last.
rb	rotate b - moves all elements of stack b up one position, the first element becomes the last.
rr	ra y rb a la vez.
rra	reverse rotate a - moves all elements of the stack down to one position, the last element becomes the first.
rrb	reverse rotate b - moves all elements of the stack b down one position, the last element becomes the first.
